(U know.. uh) Music is my life.  
(I mean) without music, my life would be an absolute mess.  
(Like) just last week, my boss was giving me a lot of stress.  
But when I came home, all I had to do was pop on my earphones  
and I was just able to be relaxed.  
I was calm and I felt so good.  
I would have to say one of my favorite songs would have to be "Fake love"  
(Ok, uh.. what am I trying to say...)  
(Uh) it's a song that's just so~ upbeat. It's so~ energetic  
(and um)it just makes me feel better.  
I could be having the worst day of my life.  
But I pop on that song (and uh) I just feel so great.
