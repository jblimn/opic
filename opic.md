(U know.. uh) Music is my life.  
(I mean) without music, my life would be an absolute mess.  
(Like) just last week, my boss was giving me a lot of stress.  
But when I came home, all I had to do was pop on my earphones  
and I was just able to be relaxed.  
I was calm and I felt so good.  
I would have to say one of my favorite songs would have to be "Fake love"  
(Ok, uh.. what am I trying to say...)  
(Uh) it's a song that's just so~ upbeat. It's so~ energetic  
(and um)it just makes me feel better.  
I could be having the worst day of my life.  
But I pop on that song (and uh) I just feel so great.

Just before this test, I drank some coffee.

Hi, I'm Ryan.  
(um..) I don't really know what to tell you about myself.  

But (Uh), these days I'm really into KPOP music.  
Because (um u know... u know what?)  
I gained a lot of weight these days, so I really need to lose my weight.  
So, I decided to take KPOP dance lessons to lose my weight.  

So, I went there.  
(Actually, u know what?) I only took 2 classes so far this week.  
I'm gonna keep learning, Ok?  
And that's pretty much all I have to say about myself.

I go [jogging] almost every day. I try to do it as often as I can.  
My neighborhood has some really great [parks].  
I normally go with my family or friends.  
We usually pack out things and go there when the weather is nice.  
We go to nearest [park] by bicycle.  
It takes about 10 minutes from home.  
We are all pretty hardcore about it.  
We stop from time to time to enjoy the view or have a snack.
