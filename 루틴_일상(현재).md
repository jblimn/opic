I go [jogging] almost every day. I try to do it as often as I can.  
My neighborhood has some really great [parks].  
I normally go with my family or friends.  
We usually pack out things and go there when the weather is nice.  
We go to nearest [park] by bicycle.  
It takes about 10 minutes from home.  
We are all pretty hardcore about it.  
We stop from time to time to enjoy the view or have a snack.
