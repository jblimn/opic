Hi, I'm Ryan.

But (Uh), these days I absolutely love coffee. I can't get enough of it.  
(U know) I woke up, I drank some coffee.  
Just before this test, I drank some coffee.  
And right after the test, I'm sure u can guess what I will do.  
I am a coffee enthusiast.  
I am a totally addicted to coffee.  
(And u know,) that's all u need to know about me.

Hi, I'm Ryan.  
(um..) I don't really know what to tell you about myself.  

But (Uh), these days I'm really into KPOP music.  
Because (um u know... u know what?)  
I gained a lot of weight these days, so I really need to lose my weight.  
So, I decided to take KPOP dance lessons to lose my weight.  

So, I went there.  
(Actually, u know what?) I only took 2 classes so far this week.  
I'm gonna keep learning, Ok?  
And that's pretty much all I have to say about myself.
